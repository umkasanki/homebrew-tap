  caveats <<~EOS
    AllyClicker needs Accessibility permission to inject clicks:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → enable AllyClicker

    It is not notarized. Clear the quarantine flag once so macOS lets it launch:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/AllyClicker.app"
