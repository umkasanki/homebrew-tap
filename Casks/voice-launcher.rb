# Homebrew Cask for Voice Launcher.
#
# The live cask is Casks/voice-launcher.rb in umkasanki/homebrew-tap; the
# release workflow bumps its version and sha256 only, so change anything else
# in both places.
#
# Install (users):
#   brew tap umkasanki/tap
#   brew trust umkasanki/tap        # third-party taps must be trusted once
#   brew install --cask voice-launcher

  caveats <<~EOS
    On first launch Voice Launcher asks for the microphone and for speech
    recognition. Both are needed; recognition runs on this Mac.
